##Adding Bluetooth and Platform Components in Simplicity Studio v5
#Introduction
Simplicity Studio v5 (SSv5) introduces change in development aspects, such as project creation, configuration tools, code structure, and so on. This lab focuses on getting started with Bluetooth using SSv5 by building a basic example and extending the capabilities of the projects by adding iBeacon, LED, and button components using the Project Configurator and component editor tools.

This guide is designed for developers who are new to Simplicity Studio v5 and the Silicon Labs development hardware. It provides instructions to get started using the example applications provided with the Gecko v3 SDK (GSDK).
