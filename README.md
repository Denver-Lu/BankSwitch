5. Click on "Create New Project" in the upper right hand corner. A "New Project Wizard" window should appear.
6. For this lab, the Bluetooth -> SoC Empty project will be used as the starter project. Scroll and select Bluetooth -> SoC Empty. 
Note: to filter the projects, Select/Checked the Bluetooth for the "Technology Type" and empty for "keywords".
<img src="https://github.com/silabs-DenverL/ADCxSyncCapture/blob/master/Project_filter.png"/>

7. Click Next to move on.
8. Rename the project under "Project name". For this lab, name the project soc_spi_acc.
<img src="https://github.com/silabs-DenverL/ADCxSyncCapture/blob/master/Project_rename.png"/>

9. Select (check) "Copy contents" under "With Project files" to copy the project files into your project. This makes version control easier to manage and future updates to the Simplicity Studio libraries will not impact the copied files in this project.
10. Check "Use default location" (workspace).
11. Click Finish to generate the project.
12. The IDE perspective launchered automatically.
<img src="https://github.com/silabs-DenverL/ADCxSyncCapture/blob/master/IDE_windows.png"/>

13. You could see gatt_configuration.btconf, soc_spi_acc.slcp and readme showed up.

#### Recap of this step:
In fact, the SOC Empty project will install some software components. You could check what has installed via checking the "Installed Components" under "Software Components", you will see component like below were installed:
- Advanced Configurator -> Bluetooth GATT Configurator
- Bluethooth -> OTA -> AppLoader,
- Platform -> services->Sleep Timer
- etc.



### Installing the imu sensor components
14. Select the Software Components tab at the top.
15. Scroll down to the "Platform" section. Notice how there are many components available that you can install for your application with ease.
16. Install the following components using the Install button as shown in the image. The process is repeated for all components needed to add.
- Services -> IO stream ->IO Stream: USART (dependent).
<img src="https://github.com/silabs-DenverL/ADCxSyncCapture/blob/master/IO_Stream.png"/>

- Platform -> Board Driver -> IMU - Inertial Measurement Unit
<img src="https://github.com/silabs-DenverL/ADCxSyncCapture/blob/master/sensor_imu_sensor.png"/>

- Bluetooth -> GATT -> Inertial Measurement Unit GATT Service.
- Bluetooth -> Sensor -> Inertial Measurement Unit Sensor.
<img src="https://github.com/silabs-DenverL/ADCxSyncCapture/blob/master/GATT_Sensor.png"/>

#### Recap of this step (explanation):
##### ICM20648 Motion Sensor
After you add/install the motion sensor component, you will see some files was added. For example, sl_icm20648.c and sl_icm20648.h will be added.

<img src="https://github.com/silabs-DenverL/ADCxSyncCapture/blob/master/ICM20648_driver.png"/>

##### Inertial Measurement Unit GATT Service.
After you add/install the Inertial Measurement Unit GATT Service, you will see somes other files was added.
In file sl_event_handler, you could see the API was added into the routine sl_internal_app_process_action.

<img src="https://github.com/silabs-DenverL/ADCxSyncCapture/blob/master/GATT_Service.png"/>

If you open the config -> btconf -> gatt_configuration.btcon gatt configure file, you could see the Acceleration and Orientation was added.

<img src="https://github.com/silabs-DenverL/ADCxSyncCapture/blob/master/Acceleration_Orientation.png"/>

In file sl_event_handler, you could see the API was added into the routine sl_internal_app_process_action.
```
void sl_internal_app_process_action(void)
{
  sl_gatt_service_imu_step();
}
```

Note: UUID for Acceleration and Orientation could be attained in this step.

### Adding the Project Source Files
17. Copy app.c source file to the top level of the project. The source files (automatically added included) and code details are found at the Code Explanation section of this doc. App.c will overwrite the existing file to add the new application. The source files can be dragged and dropped into Simplicity Studio or placed in this file path.

C:\Users\user_acount\SimplicityStudio\v5_workshop\soc_spi_acc
Where user_acount is the default workspace and SS installation path.
You can also edit the app.c file manually if you prefer to this way.

### Build and Flash the Project
18. Build the project by clicking on the hammer icon in the top left corner of the Simplicity Studio IDE perspective.
Right-click on the hex file and select Flash to Device... to make the Flash Programmer window appear. 
Note: if a Device Selection window appears, select the correct device.
19. Click Program to flash the device.
Note: The BG22 has additional security features and in some cases (i.e., when the board is first plugged in), the tools will prompt to query the Debug Challenge Interface (DCI). Select the connected device and then the link for “Click to Query Lock Status.” The device target to program text will no longer be grayed out and then select “OK.”

## Code Explanation
The following sections explain critical lines of code pertinent to this lab. The code can be found in different files (driver).
### Accelerometer (icm20648) Driver
#### sl_icm20648_config.h
This is a header file generated automatically by the Simplicity Studio pintool/software component. You may need to change the pin map based on your hardware.
Use the software components->Platform->Board drivers->ICM20648->Configure to change this.
<img src="https://github.com/silabs-DenverL/ADCxSyncCapture/blob/master/pintool.png"/>

#### sl_icm20648.c
C:\SiliconLabs\SimplicityStudio\v5\developer\sdks\gecko_sdk_suite\v3.1\hardware\driver\icm20648\src
This is the driver file for ICM20648 prepared by Silabs. If you use sensor from aother vendor, you may need to consider to implement the similar driver for it.
Please consider to contact with the vendor of the sensor you use to get help on how implementing the driver.


#### sl_imu_fuse.c/ sl_imu.c/ sl_sensor_imu.c
These are re-pack of the API provided in sl_icm20648.c. The high level code (app.c) call API like sl_sensor_imu_init, sl_sensor_imu_get and others provided in these files to initialize and enable/disable the imu sensor. These files are in folder like below:
C:\SiliconLabs\SimplicityStudio\v5\developer\sdks\gecko_sdk_suite\v3.1\hardware\driver\imu\src
C:\SiliconLabs\SimplicityStudio\v5\developer\sdks\gecko_sdk_suite\v3.1\app\bluetooth\common\sensor_imu


### Application (app.c)

The SoC-Empty project generates a default app.c source file with a skeleton Bluetooth event handler. The app.c file provided for this lab adds code to handle the BLE connection and notifications.
#### Connection Opened
The imu sensor is initialized and enabled when event sl_bt_evt_connection_opened_id received. The imu sampling does not start sampling until a connection has been made and the user has enabled GATT notifications acceleration (or orientation) characteristics. 
```
    static void sensor_init(void)
    {
      sl_sensor_imu_init();
      sl_sensor_imu_enable(true);
    }
    
    // -------------------------------
    // This event indicates that a new connection was opened.
    case sl_bt_evt_connection_opened_id:
      sensor_init();
      break;
      
```

#### Connection Closed
When the connection is closed, the sl_bt_evt_connection_closed_id event is triggered, to save power when no devices are connected the sensor was disabled via sensor_deinit() function.

```
    // -------------------------------
    // This event indicates that a connection was closed.
    case sl_bt_evt_connection_closed_id:
      // Restart advertising after client has disconnected.
      sc = sl_bt_advertiser_start(
        advertising_set_handle,
        advertiser_general_discoverable,
        advertiser_connectable_scannable);
      sl_app_assert(sc == SL_STATUS_OK,
                    "[E: 0x%04x] Failed to start advertising\n",
                    (int)sc);
      break;
```

### BLE notification
Once the user has enabled GATT notifications to the characteristic, the sl_bt_evt_gatt_server_characteristic_status_id event is triggered. In this event, the device will periodically update the characteristic value until the device disconnects. 

#### sl_event_handler.c
C:\Users\delu\SimplicityStudio\v5_workshop\soc_spi_acc\autogen
```
    void sl_internal_app_process_action(void)
    {
      sl_sensor_sound_step();
    }
```
#### sl_gatt_service_imu.c
C:\SiliconLabs\SimplicityStudio\v5\developer\sdks\gecko_sdk_suite\v3.1\app\bluetooth\common\gatt_service_imu
```
    void sl_gatt_service_imu_step(void)
    {
      if (imu_state) {
        if (SL_STATUS_OK == sl_gatt_service_imu_get(imu_ovec, imu_avec)) {
          if (imu_acceleration_notification) {
            imu_acceleration_notify();
          }
          if (imu_orientation_notification) {
            imu_orientation_notify();
          }
        }
      }
    }
```

## Porting consideration
### Other Drivers
BG22 Thunderboard also integrated other sensors:
- Silabs Relative humidity & temperature sensor: I2C [Si7021](https://www.silabs.com/sensors/humidity/si7006-13-20-21-34)
- Silabs UV and ambient light sensor: I2C [Si1133](https://www.silabs.com/sensors/optical/si1133)
- Silabs Hall effect sensor: I2C [Si7210](https://www.silabs.com/sensors/magnetic/si7210)

If your solution need these sensors, you may use similar procedure to add them.
### Bootloader
The SOC Empty project don't have the bootloader, ensure to program the bootloader to the device first. In some cases, the bootloader may be missing from the device if it has been completely erased. If that happens:
-  Optional solutions:
    -  open the Flash Programmer and program the bootloader found here:
C:\SiliconLabs\SimplicityStudio_v5\developer\sdks\gecko_sdk_suite\v3.1\platform\bootloader\sample-apps\bootloader-storage-internal-single-512k\efr32mg22c224f512im40-brd4182a\bootloader-storage-internal-single-512k.s37
    -  flash a demo example first (like Bluetooth SOC - thunderboard EFR32BG22), then flash the applicatin got here.
